-----------------------------------Implementation of Persistent Data Structures--------------------------------------------------------------

Part of IISc E0 251 DSA course
Developed towards the fulfilment of Assignment 4 of the mentioned course

Developed by: Hari Shrawgi

Language: C
Libraries Used (C): stdlib, stdio

-----------------------------------Implementation of Dynamic Memory Allocators--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Basic Introduction
----------------------

All the src code has been written to implement various persistent data structres and also an application of the same.

Following data structures have been developed with partial persistence:
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List
  - Stack
  - Queue
  - Double Ended Queue

Binary Search tree data structure has fully functional partial persistence, but it has been created for full persistence.
The code for full persistence is there, but not fully functional (lack fo time).

Rope data structre has also been developed and a working simple text editor has been created to demosntrate it's use.

2. Salient Features
--------------------

- All the partially persistent data structures have been developed using the "best" method
  The method used is the Tarjan hybrid method to achieve persistence.
- Also implemented Garbage Collection for some of the partially persistent data structures
- The BST developed is almost fully persistent, but for now the program has been restricted to
  partial persistence, so that everything runs gracefully.
- The application has been able to achieve everything that has been advertized in the proposal
- There is proper reuse of the developed code ineternally. For example, stack, queue and DEqueue, all use
  the various linked list data structures developed as part of the assignment
- The partially persistent part is especially very abstract and portable
- The different modules are very loosely coupled

3. Code description
--------------------

The src code is divided into three components:

A. Partially Persistent:

This is the part that has implementations of all the partially persistent data structures.

The code has a lot of dependencies ineternally, as there is a lot of reuse. All these are
covered in the makefile.

There is a single main file, which can be used to test all the 6 data structures.

B. Fully Persistent:

This is the part that has teh BST Implementation.
The implementation supports partial persistence completely.

Regarding, full persistence, the code is there. The only missing part is linearized version list.
This was not done due to lack of time, but can be easily added. And this would allow the implementation
to support full persistence as well.

There is a single main file, which can be used to test the implementation.

C. Applciation:

This part deals with the Rope data structure and also the simple text-editor applciation which uses Rope.

The text-editor is a prototype which supports all the operations of a simple text-editor. It is a menu-driven
editor which allows you to:
  - append strings
  - Undo (upto any level)
  - print the text
  - print text of any previous version (basically to see how much to undo)

The text-editor program can be tested using the makefile and running the program.

5. Testing
----------

Performing testing is simple. Just use the corresponding makefiles and then run the program.
